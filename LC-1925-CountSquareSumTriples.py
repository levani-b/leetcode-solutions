# https://leetcode.com/problems/count-square-sum-triples/

class Solution:
    def countTriples(self, n: int) -> int:
        count = 0
        for a in range(1, n + 1):
            for b in range(1, n + 1):
                c_squared = (a * a) + (b * b)
                c = int(c_squared ** 0.5)

                if c <= n and c * c == c_squared:
                    count += 1
        return count
